Battle Area: Visualizes choices using emojis (e.g., 🪨 VS ✂️) to make the game more engaging.

Real-time Scoring: Tracks scores for both the user and the computer.

Smart Logic: Computer moves are generated randomly using JavaScript's Math.random().

Responsive Design: Works smoothly on both desktops and mobile devices.

New Game / Reset: Easily restart the game and reset scores with a single click.


🛠️ Tech Stack Used
HTML5: For the structure of the game.

CSS3: For styling, Flexbox layout, and hover animations.
